# Slurpsup

Simple web application written in Angular 6 used to review juices. This project is very much a work in progress (So much needs fixing and cleaning up) but feel free to pull down the code and play around. 

In order to get the application running successfully you will need to create a firebase datastore. Update the environment.ts file with your firebase config and the app should work as normal.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

## Demo

<div>
    <img src="../demo.gif" width="300" height="500" />
</div>


### Prerequisites

What things you need to get started:

```
node
angular cli
firebase DB
```

## Running the Application
1. cd into the app directory
2. run `npm install` 
###### (This will install all dependencies for the application)
3. run `ng serve -o` 
###### (This will serve the application at `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.. The `-o flag` automatically brings up the browser)

By running ng serve by default the application runs locally. The front end SPA can run without a Firebase DB configured up. However this will stop you from uploading and viewing juice reviews.

```
note: I am currently in the middle of writing a series of blogs on how to create this project from scratch. Follow my Medium account to find out more.

## Running the tests

Application currently has no tests.
